Input : handled by text file input , can alter the input by changing the file name at the top of main file to link to a separate file or edit the 'nodeInput' text file itself.

Done :
	- Basic BT structure.
	- All functions needed to interat with BT.
	- Displaying BT in the console.
	- Lowest Common Ancestor implementation.
	- File Input and filtering so only ints will be accepted to build BT.
	- File input error handling.
	- Option to allow for test file to be inputed to test building of BT.
ToDo :
	- More error checking + testing.
	- Allow user to exit at anypoint.
